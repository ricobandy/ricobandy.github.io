Hey there ! I'm a CyberSec enthusiast, CTF player and an aspiring penetration tester. I hack vulnerable machines most of the time so I'm going to share a lot of write-ups about them here. What I share on this blog is a contribution to the community and something for myself to look at as a resource when I'm looking for a trick or a payload I forgot about.
